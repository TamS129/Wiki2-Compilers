# CSB310-Collab-Wiki-2-Compilers
Collaborative Wiki 2 - Compilers

Purpose: To practice and demonstrate proficiency in researching compilers and their purpose.

Skills Used: Research, Writing, Communication, Comprehension

Knowledge Goals: Dependent on the question chosen




Summary

In this assignment, you will use Github to collaboratively work on a Wiki around the compilers. You are expected to use proper version control procedures for interacting with the repo that will contain your Wiki. You are required to use Git and Github for this project in a way that showcases that individual contributions of each team member.

The process should be that your team will divide up the topics around compilers listed below. Your file you write in Markdown language (a file that has the .md extension) of which there is a tutorial on this here. The practice with markdown will be helpful for you in your future. 

You will probably encounter merge conflicts as you are working on this. Please handle these accordingly. This assignment is not only about learning the concepts in Programming Languages but also to get practice with using Githhub and version control.




Step 1: Divide up the topics around compilers
What is a compiler and what is its purpose?
Give a brief history of the development of the compiler.
What are the operations of the compiler?
What are the 3 phases of compilers?
Define and explain the similarities and differences between these types of compilers:
Single Pass Compilers
Two Pass Compilers
Multipass Compilers
What is the difference between a compiled and intrepretd language? What are the use cases, advantages and disadvantages of each?




Step 2: Create a graphic

Produce a graphics showing the phases and operations of a compileer




Please use the following link to access the Github Repo:

You are required to fork the repo to your own Github and then clone it to your machine. Work on it and then you can push up your version and create a Pull Request.

If you wish to work on this in Google Documents or Word Online, you are free to do so. Once a person has completed their portion of the document, they would create a branch, add it to the master md file in the repo for the group, stage it (add), create a commit and push it up to Github repo and create a PR.

Why do we have to do this process when we could just create it in Word Online and it would save us so much time? 

- Thats a great question. The reason is because it is our desire for you to understand Git and Github in a way that really sets you apart when you are interviewing for your internships. For that reason, practice with these is part of our everyday work.




Format Requirements
Your submission has to have a minimum of 1000 words.

Assessment

This is a group grade. If anyone is not pulling their weight, please discuss with them during a team meet and if that does not work, then discuss with the professor for further action. See the rubric for details on grading. Performance Reviews are not required currently for Collab Wikis but if it is found team members are not pulling their weight, it can be added.




Deliverables
Completion in Github. Any commits made after due date will be considered to follow the late penalty. Submit a link to the Github repo here.
